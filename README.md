# Database-Application-for-Healthcare-Personnel-Management

    The application is to develop a database system to help health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep track of the health status of their employees and the people who live with their employees. It is a web-based application with a  Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate interactions of the end-users with the system.
    The system maintains information related to the pandemic about the employees of the facilities, the people who live with the employees and the residence of the employees. Information includes residence of every person, date, nature and type of infection and nature of infection. Also, information about the vaccination of every person including the vaccination date, the type of vaccination, and the dose number of the vaccination. The information maintained by the system is used to help the facilities to keep track of their employeesâ€™ residence and health status to reduce the risk of contamination between the employees of the facilities.
    The system also includes automated functionalities such as biweekly schedule generation, schedule cancellation in case of current infection cases, email notification to infected personnel and personnel who have come in contact with infected employees.
